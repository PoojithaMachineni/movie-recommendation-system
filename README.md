Movie Recommendation Using Collaborative System

Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system uses a dataset of movie ratings and applies machine learning techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

Features
- Generates movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering.
- Utilizes a user-input movie name to provide a list of similar movies.
- Implements a Gradio-based user interface for easy interaction.
- Displays movie posters alongside recommendations for a better user experience.

Usage
- Open the Gradio interface.
- Enter a movie name in the input field.
- The system will return a list of recommended movies along with their images.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio
- Matplotlib

Dataset
The system uses a movie ratings dataset such as **MovieLens**. If required, download the dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Output
- The system suggests similar movies based on collaborative filtering.
- Displays movie posters alongside recommendations.
- Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Future Improvements
- Improve recommendation accuracy with hybrid filtering techniques.
- Enhance UI for a better user experience.
- Expand dataset to include more diverse movie ratings.
